# HydroPower_X-Capstone_Project

The purpose of the study is to raise the availability of energy in an environmentally responsible way by using modern renewable energy generation system communication capabilities, notably the hydro-energy of rivers and oceans. The uniqueness of hydropower energy stems from its accessibility to multiple
countries worldwide and able to create massive quantities of clean energy. The chosen solution is based on a specific form of water turbine called a crossflow turbine installed in a semi-closed pipe to enhance the flow rate and water pressure, increasing the generator's RPM,considerably growing the generation. The study's major findings of the prototype testing indicated that the water flow rate rises significantly through the pipe, as demonstrated by data from both the water flow and RPM sensors, resulting in increased torque for the generator. Consequently, the project would produce a massive quantity of energy, outperforming all other projects of the same category in terms of efficiency and cost. Eventually, according to the past findings, the project implements all the design requirements of low cost and high efficiency, making it the bedrock of tackling the lack of alternative energy use problem, pollution, and shortage of fossil resources.
